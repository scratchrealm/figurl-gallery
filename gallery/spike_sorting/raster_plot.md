title: Raster plot
description: "A raster plot is a visualization that shows the spikes or \"action potentials\" of a neuron over time. It is a 2D graph with time on the x-axis and spike number on the y-axis, with each spike represented as a vertical line. It is used for visualizing the spiking activity of a neuron, allowing neuroscientists to study how the neuron responds to stimuli."

# Raster plot

A raster plot is a visualization that shows the spikes or "action potentials" of a neuron over time. It is a 2D graph with time on the x-axis and spike number on the y-axis, with each spike represented as a vertical line. It is used for visualizing the spiking activity of a neuron, allowing neuroscientists to study how the neuron responds to stimuli.
